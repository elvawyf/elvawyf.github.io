Math support is a good addition, except that it makes the Preview blink and blink again whenever typing, as it needs to refresh the whole typesetting. It makes the Right View always scroll to top whenever typing. That’s why I make it disabled by default. I suggest only enable it when you write Math Formulas, or better, only enable it when you export document to HTML which contains Math Formulas, when you are writing, disable it. Block level vs Inline levelUse double US dollors sign pair for Block level Math formula, and three US dollors sign pair for Inline Level. For example this is a Block level $$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$$ formula, and this is an inline Level $$$x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$$$ formula. The Math SyntaxThe syntax is the same as Tex, expect one thing: Because the characters such as \\ and _ and * and so on have special meanings in Markdown language, you need to add an extra \\ character before them to escape them to make the Math renders correctly. For example in TeX syntax it starts with [ but here you need to add an extra \\ to escape it, thus \\[ And so on… Luckily you don’t have to escape every \\ characters, normally escape the beginning [ and ending ] is enough, and perhaps \\ to \\.

When the US Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, many at that time felt that the federal government outlined by the Constitution would be too strong, and that rights of individual citizens against the government had to be clarified. This led to the Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments, which were ratified at the same time as the Constitution. The first eight of these amendments list specific rights of citizens. Some leaders feared that listing some rights could be interpreted to mean that citizens didn’t have other, unlisted rights. Toward this end, James Madison and others produced the Ninth Amendment, which states: the fact that certain rights are listed in the Constitution shall not be construed to imply that other rights of the people are denied. Constitutional traditionalists interpret the Ninth Amendment as a rule for reading the rest of the constitution. They would argue that “Ninth Amendment rights” are a misconceived notion: the amendment does not, by itself, create federally enforceable rights. In particular, this strict reasoning would be opposed to the creation of any new rights based on the amendment. Rather, according to this view, the amendment merely protects those rights that citizens already have, whether they are explicitly listed in the Constitution or simply implicit in people’s lives and in American tradition. More liberal interpreters of the US Constitution have a much more expansive view of the Ninth Amendment. In their view, the Ninth Amendment guarantees to American citizens a vast universe of potential rights, some of which we have enjoyed for two centuries, and others of which the Founding Fathers could not possibly have conceived. These scholars point out that some rights, such as voting rights of women or minorities, were not necessarily viewed as rights by the majority of citizens in late eighteenth century America, but are taken as fundamental and unquestionable in modern America. While those rights cited are protected specifically by other amendments and laws, the argument asserts that other unlisted right also could evolve from unthinkable to perfectly acceptable, and the Ninth Amendment would protect these as-yet-undefined rights. Cool information related to this question and completely outside the passage. The 1965 US Supreme Court case Griswold vs. Connecticut established a “right to privacy”. Some of the justices in that case did ground the “right to privacy” in the Ninth Amendment, and other justices grounded it in the Fourteen Amendment. They all agree the right is there, but there’s disagreement about exactly what part of the US Constitution supports it."},{"title":"algorithm site-collection","date":"2016-09-27T16:04:35.000Z","updated":"2016-10-02T01:22:55.000Z","comments":true,"path":"de_posts/algorithm-site-collection.html","permalink":"http://elvawyf.com/de_posts/algorithm-site-collection.html","excerpt":"","text":"http://www.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/~u91029/index.html http://www.csuldw.com/2016/09/14/2016-09-14-maximum-sum-of-a-sub-matrix-in-2d-matrix/ Congratulations on finishing the first practice set!

In this project, you will use reinforcement learning to train a smartcab how to drive. EnvironmentYour smartcab operates in an idealized grid-like city, with roads going North-South and East-West. Other vehicles may be present on the roads, but no pedestrians. There is a traffic light at each intersection that can be in one of two states: North-South open or East-West open. US right-of-way rules apply: On a green light, you can turn left only if there is no oncoming traffic at the intersection coming straight. On a red light, you can turn right if there is no oncoming traffic turning left or traffic from the left going straight. To understand how to correctly yield to oncoming traffic when turning left, you may refer to this official drivers’ education video, or this passionate exposition. InputsAssume that a higher-level planner assigns a route to the smartcab, splitting it into waypoints at each intersection. And time in this world is quantized. At any instant, the smartcab is at some intersection. Therefore, the next waypoint is always either one block straight ahead, one block left, one block right, one block back or exactly there (reached the destination). The smartcab only has an egocentric view of the intersection it is currently at (sorry, no accurate GPS, no global location). It is able to sense whether the traffic light is green for its direction of movement (heading), and whether there is a car at the intersection on each of the incoming roadways (and which direction they are trying to go). In addition to this, each trip has an associated timer that counts down every time step. If the timer is at 0 and the destination has not been reached, the trip is over, and a new one may start. OutputsAt any instant, the smartcab can either stay put at the current intersection, move one block forward, one block left, or one block right (no backward movement). RewardsThe smartcab gets a reward for each successfully completed trip. A trip is considered “successfully completed” if the passenger is dropped off at the desired destination (some intersection) within a pre-specified time bound (computed with a route plan). It also gets a smaller reward for each correct move executed at an intersection. It gets a small penalty for an incorrect move, and a larger penalty for violating traffic rules and/or causing an accident. GoalDesign the AI driving agent for the smartcab. It should receive the above-mentioned inputs at each time step t, and generate an output move. Based on the rewards and penalties it gets, the agent should learn an optimal policy for driving on city roads, obeying traffic rules correctly, and trying to reach the destination within a goal time. TasksSetupYou need Python 2.7 and pygame for this project: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStartedFor help with installation, it is best to reach out to the pygame community [help page, Google group, reddit]. DownloadDownload smartcab.zip, unzip and open the template Python file agent.py (do not modify any other file). Perform the following tasks to build your agent, referring to instructions mentioned in README.md as well as inline comments in agent.py. Also create a project report (e.g. Word or Google doc), and start addressing the questions indicated in italics below. When you have finished the project, save/download the report as a PDF and turn it in with your code. Implement a basic driving agentImplement the basic driving agent, which processes the following inputs at each time step: Next waypoint location, relative to its current location and heading,Intersection state (traffic light and presence of cars), and,Current deadline value (time steps remaining),And produces some random move/action (None, &#39;forward&#39;, &#39;left&#39;, &#39;right&#39;). Don’t try to implement the correct strategy! That’s exactly what your agent is supposed to learn. Run this agent within the simulation environment with enforce_deadline set to False (see run function in agent.py), and observe how it performs. In this mode, the agent is given unlimited time to reach the destination. The current state, action taken by your agent and reward/penalty earned are shown in the simulator. In your report, mention what you see in the agent’s behavior. Does it eventually make it to the target location? Identify and update stateIdentify a set of states that you think are appropriate for modeling the driving agent. The main source of state variables are current inputs, but not all of them may be worth representing. Also, you can choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination (vector) of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the current state. Run it again (and as often as you need) to observe how the reported state changes through the run. Justify why you picked these set of states, and how they model the agent and its environment. Implement Q-LearningImplement the Q-Learning algorithm by initializing and updating a table/mapping of Q-values at each time step. Now, instead of randomly selecting an action, pick the best action available from the current state based on Q-values, and return that. Each action generates a corresponding numeric reward or penalty (which may be zero). Your agent should take this into account when updating Q-values. Run it again, and observe the behavior. What changes do you notice in the agent’s behavior? Enhance the driving agentApply the reinforcement learning techniques you have learnt, and tweak the parameters (e.g. learning rate, discount factor, action selection method, etc.), to improve the performance of your agent. Your goal is to get it to a point so that within 100 trials, the agent is able to learn a feasible policy - i.e. reach the destination within the allotted time, with net reward remaining positive. Report what changes you made to your basic implementation of Q-Learning to achieve the final version of the agent. How well does it perform? Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties? EvaluationYour project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against this rubric. Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. All criteria must “meet specifications” in order to pass. SubmissionWhen you’re ready to submit your project go back to your Udacity Home, click on Project 4, and we’ll walk you through the rest of the submission process. You need to turn in your final code (agent.py only) and report as a PDF file. If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at machine-support@udacity.com or visit us in the discussion forums. What’s Next?You will get an email as soon as your reviewer has feedback for you.

In&nbsp;[123]: %reset Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])? y Getting Started&#182;In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. For the purposes of this project, the features 'Channel' and 'Region' will be excluded in the analysis — with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers. Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported. In&nbsp;[124]: # Import libraries necessary for this project import numpy as np import pandas as pd import renders as rs from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames # Show matplotlib plots inline (nicely formatted in the notebook) %matplotlib inline # Load the wholesale customers dataset try: data = pd.read_csv(&quot;customers.csv&quot;) data.drop([&#39;Region&#39;, &#39;Channel&#39;], axis = 1, inplace = True) print &quot;Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.&quot;.format(*data.shape) except: print &quot;Dataset could not be loaded.

You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project. Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: 'Fresh', 'Milk', 'Grocery', 'Frozen', 'Detergents_Paper', and 'Delicatessen'. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase. In&nbsp;[126]: # Display a description of the dataset display(data.describe().round(2)) Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen count 440.00 440.00 440.00 440.00 440.00 440.00 mean 12000.30 5796.27 7951.28 3071.93 2881.49 1524.87 std 12647.33 7380.38 9503.16 4854.67 4767.85 2820.11 min 3.00 55.00 3.00 25.00 3.00 3.00 25% 3127.75 1533.00 2153.00 742.25 256.75 408.25 50% 8504.00 3627.00 4755.50 1526.00 816.50 965.50 75% 16933.75 7190.25 10655.75 3554.25 3922.00 1820.25 max 112151.00 73498.00 92780.00 60869.00 40827.00 47943.00 Implementation: Selecting Samples&#182;To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add three indices of your choice to the indices list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another. In&nbsp;[127]: # TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset import random # indices = [random.randint(0, data.shape[0] - 1) for _ in range(3)] indices = [100, 250, 385] print &quot;Select the sample: &quot;, indices # Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True) print &quot;Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:&quot; display(samples) Select the sample: [100, 250, 385] Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset: Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen 0 11594 7779 12144 3252 8035 3029 1 3191 1993 1799 1730 234 710 2 11635 922 1614 2583 192 1068 Question 1&#182;Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers. What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent? Hint: Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, and retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying \"McDonalds\" when describing a sample customer as a restaurant. Answer: What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent? The indices = 100 data point most likely represents a large scale restaurant. The values of all categories, except fresh, are over the 75% (upper 25%) of the data, which may mean the data point represents a high-end restaurant. The indices = 250 data point most likely represents a small-size restaurant. Annual spending amounts for 5 categories are in the lower 25% of the data, and the delicatessen are near the lower 25%. The indices = 385 data point has 3 categories (milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper) in the lower 25%. On the other hand, spending on fresh is in the upper 25% and annual spending on delicatessen are near the median. The annual spending pattern indicates that this customer most likely represents a median- or smaller-size grocery store. The percentile ranks and the samples compared to median and to mean can provide descriptions above. In&nbsp;[128]: import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # look at percentile ranks pcts = data.rank(axis = 0, pct = True).iloc[indices].round(decimals = 3) display(pcts) # visualize percentiles with heatmap plt.title(&#39;Percentile ranks of\\nsamples\\&#39; category spending&#39;) display(sns.heatmap(pcts, vmin = 0, vmax = 1, annot = True)) Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen 100 0.625 0.786 0.802 0.730 0.914 0.905 250 0.257 0.327 0.184 0.534 0.223 0.399 385 0.627 0.116 0.143 0.664 0.177 0.548 &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x112a138d0&gt; In&nbsp;[129]: # Plot of samples compared to median or to mean ((samples - data.median()) / data.median()).plot.bar(figsize = (16,6), title = &#39;Samples compared to MEDIAN&#39;) ((samples - data.mean()) / data.mean()).plot.bar(figsize = (16,6), title = &#39;Samples compared to MEAN&#39;); Implementation: Feature Relevance&#182;One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Assign new_data a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the DataFrame.drop function. Use sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split to split the dataset into training and testing sets. Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a test_size of 0.25 and set a random_state. Import a decision tree regressor, set a random_state, and fit the learner to the training data. Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's score function. In&nbsp;[130]: # TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the &#39;drop&#39; function to drop the given feature from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor # loop in all features for i in data.columns: new_data = data.drop(i, axis = 1) target = data[i] # TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets using the given feature as the target X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data, target, test_size = 0.25, random_state = 42) # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 42) regressor = regressor.fit(X_train, y_train) # TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test) print &quot;The removed features &quot; + i + &quot;, R^2 score is:&quot;, round(score,4) The removed features Fresh, R^2 score is: -0.3857 The removed features Milk, R^2 score is: 0.1563 The removed features Grocery, R^2 score is: 0.6819 The removed features Frozen, R^2 score is: -0.2101 The removed features Detergents_Paper, R^2 score is: 0.2717 The removed features Delicatessen, R^2 score is: -2.2547 Question 2&#182;Which feature did you attempt to predict? What was the reported prediction score? Is this feature is necessary for identifying customers' spending habits? Hint: The coefficient of determination, R^2, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative R^2 implies the model fails to fit the data. Answer: Which feature did you attempt to predict? For global observation, I write a loop function for try every features. What was the reported prediction score? The removed features Fresh, R^2 score is: -0.3857 The removed features Milk, R^2 score is: 0.1563 The removed features Grocery, R^2 score is: 0.6819 The removed features Frozen, R^2 score is: -0.2101 The removed features Detergents_Paper, R^2 score is: 0.2717 The removed features Delicatessen, R^2 score is: -2.2547 Is this feature is necessary for identifying customers' spending habits? Based on the results, the $R^2$ 0.6819 of removed Grocery is significant. The Grocery feature may not necessary for identifying customers' spending habits, as its determination score is very high which means we can get the same information from other features. Visualize Feature Distributions&#182;To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix. In&nbsp;[131]: # Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = &#39;kde&#39;); Question 3&#182;Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? How is the data for those features distributed? Hint: Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? Answer: Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? The grocery, milk, detergents_papers with each other pairs exhibit a slope of correlation. The delicatessen with other features pairs almost don't exhibit correlation. Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? Yes, the result confirm the suspicions of removed delicatessen. But, we should continue to consider the outlier and other reasons may lead to bias. How is the data for those features distributed? Those features show the exponential distribution. In&nbsp;[132]: # Plot the correlation of features plt.title(&#39;Correlation of features&#39;) # get the feature correlations corr = data.corr() # remove first row and last column for a cleaner look corr.drop([&#39;Fresh&#39;], axis = 0, inplace = True) corr.drop([&#39;Delicatessen&#39;], axis = 1, inplace = True) # create a mask so we only see the correlation values once mask = np.zeros_like(corr) mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask, 1)] = True # plot the heatmap with sns.axes_style(&quot;white&quot;): sns.heatmap(corr, mask = mask, annot = True, cmap = &#39;RdBu&#39;, fmt = &#39;+.2f&#39;, cbar = True) Data Preprocessing&#182;In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful. Implementation: Feature Scaling&#182;If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most often appropriate to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a Box-Cox test, which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Assign a copy of the data to log_data after applying a logarithm scaling. Use the np.log function for this. Assign a copy of the sample data to log_samples after applying a logrithm scaling. Again, use np.log. In&nbsp;[133]: # TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm log_data = np.log(data) # TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm log_samples = np.log(samples) # Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = &#39;kde&#39;); In&nbsp;[134]: # plot densities of log-transformed data plt.figure(figsize = (16, 6)) for i in data.columns: log_data[i].plot.kde() plt.legend() plt.title(&#39;Densities of log-transformed data&#39;); In&nbsp;[135]: from scipy.stats import boxcox # transform the data bc_df = data.copy() for col in bc_df.columns: bc_df[col], _ = boxcox(bc_df[col]) # plot densities of box-cox data plt.figure(figsize = (16, 6)) with sns.color_palette(&quot;Reds_r&quot;): for col in data.columns: sns.kdeplot(bc_df[col], shade = True) plt.title(&#39;Densities of box-cox data&#39;); Observation&#182;After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before). Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it. In&nbsp;[136]: # Display the log-transformed sample data print &quot;The original samples:&quot; display(samples) print &quot;\\nThe log-transformed samples:&quot; display(log_samples) The original samples: Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen 0 11594 7779 12144 3252 8035 3029 1 3191 1993 1799 1730 234 710 2 11635 922 1614 2583 192 1068 The log-transformed samples: Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen 0 9.358243 8.959183 9.404590 8.087025 8.991562 8.015988 1 8.068090 7.597396 7.494986 7.455877 5.455321 6.565265 2 9.361773 6.826545 7.386471 7.856707 5.257495 6.973543 Implementation: Outlier Detection&#182;Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many \"rules of thumb\" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use Tukey's Method for identfying outliers: An outlier step is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to Q1. Use np.percentile for this. Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to Q3. Again, use np.percentile. Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to step. Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the outliers list. NOTE: If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points! Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable good_data.

Should these data points be removed from the dataset? If any data points were added to the outliers list to be removed, explain why. Answer: Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? Yes, the outliers for more than one features are [ 65 66 75 128 154] Should these data points be removed from the dataset? Yes, I finally choose to remove 5 outliers which more than one features, as the good_data. Because to remove 42 data is too much based on the 440 sample datasets, which may lead to miss too much information. The K-means can be quite sensitive to outliers in dataset. The reason is simply that k-means tries to optimize the sum of squares. Thus, a large deviation (such as of an outlier) gets a lot of weight. Feature Transformation&#182;In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers. Implementation: PCA&#182;Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the good_data to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the explained variance ratio of each dimension — how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new \"feature\" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Import sklearn.decomposition.PCA and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with good_data to pca. Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data log_samples using pca.transform, and assign the results to pca_samples. In&nbsp;[138]: from sklearn.decomposition import PCA # TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features pca = PCA(n_components=6).fit(good_data) # Apply a PCA transformation to the sample log-data pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples) # Generate PCA results plot pca_results = rs.pca_results(good_data, pca) In&nbsp;[139]: display(pca_results) print &quot;Sum Explained Variance of PCA:&quot; print pca_results[&#39;Explained Variance&#39;].cumsum() Explained Variance Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen Dimension 1 0.4430 -0.1675 0.4014 0.4381 -0.1782 0.7514 0.1499 Dimension 2 0.2638 0.6859 0.1672 0.0707 0.5005 0.0424 0.4941 Dimension 3 0.1231 -0.6774 0.0402 -0.0195 0.3150 -0.2117 0.6286 Dimension 4 0.1012 -0.2043 0.0128 0.0557 0.7854 0.2096 -0.5423 Dimension 5 0.0485 0.0026 -0.7192 -0.3554 0.0331 0.5582 0.2092 Dimension 6 0.0204 -0.0292 0.5402 -0.8205 -0.0205 0.1824 -0.0197 Sum Explained Variance of PCA: Dimension 1 0.4430 Dimension 2 0.7068 Dimension 3 0.8299 Dimension 4 0.9311 Dimension 5 0.9796 Dimension 6 1.0000 Name: Explained Variance, dtype: float64 Question 5&#182;How much variance in the data is explained in total by the first and second principal component? What about the first four principal components? Using the visualization provided above, discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending. Hint: A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an increase of the positive-weighted features and a decrease of the negative-weighted features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the indivdual feature weights. Answer: How much variance in the data is explained in total by the first and second principal component? The 1st and 2nd principle components explain 70.68%. What about the first four principal components? The first four principle components explain 93.11%. In every dimensions, the specific features may exhibit different capabilities of explained the information. The plot of explained variance in specific dimension show the relationship with specific features. Using the visualization provided above, discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending. The 1st component shows that we have a lot of variance in customers who purchase Milk, Grocery and Detergents_Paper, some purchase a lot of these 3 categories while others purchase very little. The 2nd component shows that a lot of variance in customers who purchase Fresh, Frozen and Delicatessen a lot. A principal component with feature weights that have opposite directions can reveal how customers buy more in one category while they buy less in the other category. So, the 3rd component can show us customers that buy a lot of Delicatessen but little Fresh, as well as those who buy in the opposite pattern. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize. Consider a dataset in only two dimensions, like (height, weight). This dataset can be plotted as points in a plane. But if we want to tease out variation, PCA finds a new coordinate system in which every point has a new (x,y) value. The axes don't actually mean anything physical; they're combinations of height and weight called \"principal components\" that are chosen to give one axes lots of variation.

Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.

Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the cumulative explained variance ratio is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with good_data to pca. Apply a PCA transformation of good_data using pca.transform, and assign the reuslts to reduced_data. Apply a PCA transformation of the sample log-data log_samples using pca.transform, and assign the results to pca_samples. In&nbsp;[141]: # Fit PCA to the good data using only two dimensions pca = PCA(n_components = 2).fit(good_data) # Apply a PCA transformation the good data reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data) # Apply a PCA transformation to the sample log-data pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples) # Create a DataFrame for the reduced data reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = [&#39;Dimension 1&#39;, &#39;Dimension 2&#39;]) In&nbsp;[142]: # Produce a scatter matrix for pca reduced data pd.scatter_matrix(reduced_data, alpha = 0.8, figsize = (10, 5), diagonal = &#39;kde&#39;); Observation&#182;Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions.

In&nbsp;[143]: # Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = [&#39;Dimension 1&#39;, &#39;Dimension 2&#39;])) Dimension 1 Dimension 2 0 2.3579 1.7393 1 -1.5715 -0.6914 2 -2.3040 0.4534 Clustering&#182;In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. Question 6&#182;What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why? Answer: What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? K-means is simple and fast, effective for massive datasets. The omplexity is $O(n K_t)$ which is close to linear. Disadvantage: hard to confirm the $k$ and the center. What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? GMM is a probablilistic model that consider the log-likelihood function and expectation maximization, then consider the score. GMM obtains and incorporates more information than K-means about the covariance structure of the data. Compared by speed/Scalability: K-Means faster and more scalable GMM slower due to using information about the data distribution — e.g., probabilities of points belonging to clusters. Compared by cluster assignment: K-Means is hard assignment (certain) of points to cluster (assumes symmetrical spherical shapes) GMM is soft assignment (uncertain) gives more information such as probabilities (assumes elliptical shape) Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why? I choose the K-means because it seems to be a good start if you don't know much about the structure of the dataset. Reference: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-K-means-and-the-mixture-model-of-Gaussian Implementation: Creating Clusters&#182;Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known a priori, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data — if any. However, we can quantify the \"goodness\" of a clustering by calculating each data point's silhouette coefficient. The silhouette coefficient for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the mean silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Fit a clustering algorithm to the reduced_data and assign it to clusterer. Predict the cluster for each data point in reduced_data using clusterer.predict and assign them to preds. Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to centers. Predict the cluster for each sample data point in pca_samples and assign them sample_preds. Import sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score and calculate the silhouette score of reduced_data against preds. Assign the silhouette score to score and print the result. In&nbsp;[144]: from sklearn.cluster import KMeans ## from sklearn.mixture import GMM from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score scores = dict() for i in range(2,10): # (2,6) clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters = i, random_state = 42).fit(reduced_data) ## GMM(n_components = i, ...) # TODO: Predict the cluster for each data point preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data) # TODO: Find the cluster centers centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_ # TODO: Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples) # TODO: Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds) scores[i] = score print &quot;The Silhouette Score with k:&quot; display(scores) The Silhouette Score with k: {2: 0.4262810154691084, 3: 0.39689092644980506, 4: 0.33184127600936947, 5: 0.34999779752629756, 6: 0.36588522063299811, 7: 0.36480120797880017, 8: 0.36764075649149885, 9: 0.35987901460536154} Question 7&#182;Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score? Answer: Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. Silhouette Scoure with k = {2: 0.4471, 3: 0.3639, 4: 0.3311, 5: 0.3531, 6: 0.3637, 7: 0.3553, 8: 0.3689, 9: 0.3674} Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score? Chose the clusters k = 2 In&nbsp;[146]: # Apply your clustering algorithm of choice to the reduced data clusterer = KMeans(n_clusters = 2, random_state = 42).fit(reduced_data) # Predict the cluster for each data point preds = clusterer.predict(reduced_data) # Find the cluster centers centers = clusterer.cluster_centers_ # Predict the cluster for each transformed sample data point sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples) # Calculate the mean silhouette coefficient for the number of clusters chosen score = silhouette_score(reduced_data, preds) print score.round(4); 0.4263 Cluster Visualization&#182;Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. In&nbsp;[147]: # Display the results of the clustering from implementation rs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples) Implementation: Data Recovery&#182;Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the averages of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to the average customer of that segment. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations. In the code block below, you will need to implement the following: Apply the inverse transform to centers using pca.inverse_transform and assign the new centers to log_centers. Apply the inverse function of np.log to log_centers using np.exp and assign the true centers to true_centers. In&nbsp;[148]: # Inverse transform the centers log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers) # Exponentiate the centers true_centers = np.exp(log_centers) # Display the true centers segments = [&#39;Segment {}&#39;.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))] true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys()) true_centers.index = segments display(true_centers); Fresh Milk Grocery Frozen Detergents_Paper Delicatessen Segment 0 8867.0 1897.0 2477.0 2088.0 294.0 681.0 Segment 1 4005.0 7900.0 12104.0 952.0 4561.0 1036.0 Question 8&#182;Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project. What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent? Hint: A customer who is assigned to 'Cluster X' should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of 'Segment X'. Answer: What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?

First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the customer segments, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which segment that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the customer segments to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships. Question 10&#182;Companies will often run A/B tests when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would reach positively to the change in delivery service? Hint: Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most? Answer: How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would reach positively to the change in delivery service? If the wholesales distributor implement the proposed A/B test, they should effect with every segments information. For instance, considering the segment 0 with the changes of delivery service from currently 5 days to 3 days a week, the customers spending on Fresh category will be affected most. Considering the segment 1 with the changes, the customers spending on Grocery, Milk and Fresh will be affected, but the degree of Fresh is less than the segment 0. Once we run the A/B test and the results are positive, then we can consider to scale up the customer segments, and then monitor the impacts of the change. In addition, because the effect of catergories on the specific segment is not equal. We can base on the p-value of A/B test, which mean the significant effect, to compare with the segment 0 (more on Fresh) and with the segment 1 (more on Grocery, Mikl and Fresh, but less effect than segment 1 on Fresh). Reference: Pitfalls of A/B testing https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/evaluating-machine-learning-models/page/6/the-pitfalls-of-a-b-testing Question 11&#182;Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a customer segment it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider 'customer segment' as an engineered feature for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a customer segment to determine the most appropriate delivery service. How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the customer segment data? Hint: A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable? Answer: How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the customer segment data? In the supervised learning analysis, the classifications can be use in the same structure of dataset by training model for each segments. If the a new feature is added in, the model will predict the segment category for each data point as a variable, which may refine or enhance the predictive power of the supervised learning model. Visualizing Underlying Distributions&#182;At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the 'Channel' and 'Region' features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the 'Channel' feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset. Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either 'HoReCa' (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or 'Retail' the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling. In&nbsp;[154]: # Display the clustering results based on &#39;Channel&#39; data rs.channel_results(reduced_data, multiple_feature_outliers, pca_samples) Question 12&#182;How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments? Answer: How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? The clustering algorithm does a very good job compared to the underlying distribution (the red points) of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retail customers. Those are kind of establishements of represented by each segment and consistent with the underlying distribution as well. Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? There are some customers who are misclassified by the clustering, especially in the region between the two clusters. To choose a soft clustering would probably have done better and more effective. Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments? Yes, the clustering algorithm and number of clusters I've chosen seem to compare well with the underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers. In addition, I also curious about what result will the GMM shows. Theoretically, the GMM may show more of an overlap between the two clusters.

感動于霍比特人恬靜的田園生活，還有默默拯救全世界的旅程。 有些突兀，曾經刻意擱置下的寫博客的習慣重新拾起。雖然最近連續經歷階段性里程，多了卻也覺得不深不淺，但今天有些意料之外的變故，像是導火索，決定提筆了。也許此篇並不會公開太久，若屏幕前的你恰好看到，算是緣分。 個人認爲，每個人都會經歷一些與衆不同，這些經歷塑造出一種獨特。對我而言，因爲一些無可奈何的事，讓我在成人禮之後基本無法找到與我相同路徑的人，但是略顯古怪的經歷反而形成一種靠直覺來某事的習慣。本打算倒敘來講，但發現太難。 一點歷久彌新的小事，絮絮叨叨。 幼兒園時，因爲老爸職務之便，有幸成了小區裏第一個有一箱玩具的孩子，於是我有了很多朋友，加上乖巧聽話老師家長都喜歡，卻跟老爸學過一點拳擊，於是我成了小於等於我年齡的羣體裏的大姐大，我可以給他們設定級別，羣體內下級必須服從上級，否則降級懲罰，組織內人員行爲舉止獎懲同齊，可謂風生水起。後來想，其實這起源於“物質資源”和“權力靠山”，實際我並未做過多努力卻得到很多優待。 小學，有次我跟我媽說要學織毛衣和洗衣服，我媽拒絕了。因爲她說：這些事情未來並不需要做，有毛衣可以買，有洗衣機可以用，女人會有更多自由，留出時間做更值得的事。 升初中的暑假，一個傍晚，我跟老爸學做飯，我還清晰記得他在做蘑菇炒雞蛋，我問他“如果買一套房子，要多久才能收回成本？”這麼一個問題，而我直覺下一閃而過的念頭，並未得到足夠好的引導，因爲他說“不可能收回成本”。我依稀覺得哪裏不對，但也無力反駁。況且這個問題是怎麼從我腦子裏蹦出來的我都不知道，現在看大概屬於“直覺”，當然我希望自己未來的孩子，能夠在很小的年紀更多嘗試新鮮事物，思維足夠奇特，並可以有優秀的老爸老媽適時正確引導。所以我要做的事還很多。 各種玩耍這件事仍然需要感謝老爸，因爲他說自己是長子，小時候一直在努力學習維持全班第一，以至於什麼都沒玩過，成年後對任何遊戲都沒有抵抗力，他不希望這種事發生在我身上。於是，弓箭、拳擊、玩具車、玩具槍、國際象棋、天文望遠鏡、老虎機、檯球、坐飛機、坐船，只要當時那個圈子裏可得，我就會被帶着去玩。果真，我之後雖然喜歡嘗試一切新鮮有趣，但從未沉迷過任何玩樂與遊戲。對於我所喜歡的，都可以沉下心做，比如可以伏案一整天畫畫、一整天練舞不吃飯只喝水、或者持續20小時編程。 初中有段時間，我開始做租書的生意。老媽歷來大力支持我買書，有一天我突發奇想，覺得書櫃裏閒置這麼多幹嘛不租給同學？於是，列了書單，根據書的質量以及我喜愛的程度標價，從雜誌卡通心靈雞湯到名著，價格 從1角到2塊/天 不等，課間時候把書單傳給同學。我本擔心同學不買賬，特別是那些租金超過1塊錢的書，然而事實是，我想太多了，第一天就有大概10個人付了小額押金，因爲我說爲防止他們不還或者弄壞，他們竟然都很贊同，有人說喜歡這種方式，因爲能督促自己讀書。當時覺得有觸動，但不知怎麼解釋。現在想想，市場纔是正確的，這事一點也沒錯。哦對了，當時租下最貴的書那個同學，是我們同級裏面最早買房買車的一個，好像還自己做生意賣過紅酒，還練出了六塊腹肌。所以說，可能有些種子時期的微小差異大概在未來就會天壤之別了。 再後來，個子趕不上男生了，不僅沒辦法跟他們一起玩籃球，還坐到了教室第一排。有天自習課，物理老師突發奇想，轉身過來問我要不要參加競賽，但實際早都選完人了，我說好啊，於是我這樣奇特的去競賽了。當時好多人啊，放眼看過去覺得我第一次就能被刷下去了，但是每次都好神奇的被留下了，再後來的印象是，初賽沒有過，終賽卻是全國二等獎的水平，可是初賽沒過其實是然並卵的，於是並沒有然後。然後又有了很多競賽，也沒有然後。我還養成一個當時看不太好，但卻對我意義深遠的習慣：不做簡單的只做難的。所以，我大概也不怎麼給自己設限，一直認爲是逆序學習者，簡單的無法拿下是很正常的。 高中並沒有什麼印象深刻的。哦，放棄了古箏畫畫和舞蹈，還有個初中聽我唱過一次李玟的歌以後，就開始見到就問要不要跟着他學聲樂的老師，高考前一個月還專門來找過我，當然我是拒絕了。現在覺得好可惜… 高考那段提起的次數就很少了，很信得過和親密的朋友才知道詳情，也是我後來所有奇特經歷的開始，因爲基本不可能找到人跟我路徑相同了。 淘寶早期的店家裏大概有我一份，當時選了很久決定賣一種可以吃的韓國化妝品，況且護膚化妝本身對於女生就很重要，於是順便學了不同皮膚的鑑別分類以及應該買什麼類型的產品，比如干性、油性、混合T。我並不擔心存貨問題，只是聯繫到經銷商做渠道業務抽成。現在看來，根本就是高頻交易做市商策略搞的那點事。 開店並沒賺太多錢，沒堅持下去，因爲總要旺旺上線解決客戶問題實在是太耽誤我練舞了，當時辦了個街舞隊，扒下成品舞、選出不到10%的學員組舞隊，締造了幾個平時不起眼後來變男神的帥哥。再後來，對化妝品的理解開始拓展，給全宿舍女生根據性格特點修眉毛教化妝，把一個姑娘變得更美這事，還是挺有成就感的。期間某個學期玩了一個網遊，刷成了全區第一女戰弓，因爲升級太快一度被認爲是男生玩女號的人妖，副本組隊語音時才終得以沉冤得雪，滿級騎着限量版坐騎跑世界地圖不掉血的時候感覺真是：獨孤求敗，百無聊賴！從此手機電腦個人生活等等再也找不到遊戲的影子了。所以，現在評價我是學霸的親們一定不會了解，那時候玩遊戲的我跟現在是一樣的，只是學習永遠刷不到滿級。 另外，進了一次錄音棚，錄了一張唱片，10首曲子一天錄下來，中英日韓文都有，當然了是羅馬拼音而已，錄製的人對我一陣誇獎說可以考慮去找個公司投一下看看。然後我投了，有家公司說音色還不錯稍加訓練就行，要捧的話可以買斷當時一個連續劇的主題曲，30萬還是50萬我忘了，這麼不划算的買賣顯然我不會答應。再後來，非常六加一等等那些比賽，還有韓國SM公司的選拔，親身經歷後覺得，臺前的生活着實無聊，明白自己更喜歡幕後角色和沒有名字的二號位置。畢業後，直接去了一個韓國舞隊給藝人做伴舞，那段時光很難忘，每天十幾個小時的訓練，可以只喝水不吃飯，可以跳funky累到1秒鐘倒地的日子。然而，在給“溫嵐”伴舞的前夕，右膝勞損了，醫生說不適合繼續跳舞。現在看，感謝年少時狂妄，至少爲我所愛放肆努力。 進遠洋那段開始變得更有趣了，找了些資料查高管團隊，直接找到管事的HR，幾次電話追問，進了。經歷了從被客戶訓哭到後來訓客戶的蛻變，經歷市場低谷依然做了銷冠，訓練出售樓處被砸的同時帶着客戶簽約的穩勁兒，習得拉客戶一把後來升級成鐵桿朋友的過程，還有即使被小人算計依然清醒自己要成爲怎樣的人，這些都是我所享受的成長。因爲電話和會面加起來大概帶了4000組客戶，好玩的事情太多了，一時難以闡述。現在看，做事要先有立場，對事情發展有判斷，再決定說話的尺度；工作中不要站隊，工作和生活分開，避免辦公室戀情，在任何情況下做好手邊事，同時留意自我發展。說起來很俗，但是真的。特別是現在進了創業公司。 後來學了點皮毛，考了幾個證，就跳去做紅璽臺策劃了，因爲要做整合營銷，於是學了些奢侈品，開始經常接觸奢侈品牌和豪車分銷商，多了覺得也就那樣，創辦了個紅酒雪茄吧，爲了進貨稍微瞭解了點相關知識，但因爲不喜歡紅酒後來都忘了。客戶都是富豪和富婆，私人訂製活動是段少有經歷不錯，公司給你錢來創造讓客戶滿意的高端氛圍，但有些客戶的確扼殺廣告人的創意……這兩段是我僅有的地產行業經歷，要說成長，除了上面說的那些，大概還更激發了我想要開拓眼界的慾望，因爲總能看到隱形階級的內在外在影響。層次，這件事可以寫一篇文章。然而前面的還不是重點，重點是當年爲了做銷冠做豪宅策劃，對全北京普通住宅豪宅和貸款運作方式的積累，有了個小窩。 關於轉行，因爲住宅市區用地只有高端項目，實際上豪宅就市調時候的那麼幾家，普通住宅和別墅離城區太遠，顯然無法滿足我下班總要去學英語的時間表；商業地產在投放使用後的價值曲線基本依賴於物業水平，顯然我是不會對物業感興趣的；建築設計那是另外一個坑，高端的碰不到，像豪宅項目的設計師對於空間的使用的確令人歎爲觀止，而像遠洋當年的經典戶型圖基本是直接被各個項目拿來主義，兩者間有難以逾越的鴻溝，其餘並不瞭解太多也不再贅述。 於是，我在家的點點上爲中心，1.5公里爲半徑畫了一個圈，進了一家期貨公司。看起來好像轉行了，然而剛開始看大宗商品的時候，我的內心是糾結的。從一個天天跟千萬級客戶、Prada、哈雷摩托、捷豹這種打交道的狀態，突然開始看玉米大豆螺紋鋼，雖然體量實際更大。大概有半年的鬱悶期，找很多朋友聽取意見，考CFA參加討論會考慮讀書等等。也因爲這段鬱悶尋找方向的時期，得到一次去灣區的機會，三藩、Berkeley、Google、Stanford、認識新朋友、接觸比特幣，像是被科技感洗禮的旅程，回國我決定開始學編程。 寫了這麼長，終於要再次進入重點了。大方確定以後，繼續尋找細節就變得有趣很多，CFA備考過程直接讓我明白，我是有多麼不喜歡 Accounting 而喜歡 Quant，大概2013年在S學校上課那天，我跟同學說餐卡我會回來用完的，他們是並沒有迴應我的，以及我跟我媽說S的計劃時，對於一向大力支持我的她只是附和了一下，內心是並不相信的。但其實我也沒想太多，我是不刻意設限自我的。 再後來拿到SUID開始上課了，一年後成績還算滿意，神奇的裸考了個證，然後跳過商品分析師階段直接轉股指了，爲此還有些小波瀾，並無大礙不想再提，然後又入了大摩的培訓，一段有意思的經歷，培訓原本有四個方向：期貨、股票、期權、高頻。我顯然是第一眼瞄定期權，然而在選組的最後一秒，因爲考慮同期S的算法課，鬼使神差的選了高頻組。從名字上就猜得到，高頻組是異於其他三組的，背景多是EE/CS，略顯自然的，高頻組導師和我是僅有的兩位女性，高頻課題又分爲高頻算法交易、做市商策略，而做市商策略只有我們一個組在做，四人組分爲機器學習和存貨管理兩支，會跟紐約開電話會議，小組寫作和階段彙報。這期間對高頻交易食物鏈有了初步認識，也因爲這段經歷湊巧在現實生活中結識了“被約談”的那類人，讀了市面上質量殘次不齊的各種高頻交易、dark pool 相關的書，經歷政策打壓，看民衆瘋狂，市場冰火兩重天。 再後來定了美國行程以後，卻神奇的進了創業公司。實際上，有陣子關注了兩個創業公司，關注現在這個公司已經有一年時間，因爲對於量化平臺做策略開源這種想法持有一定懷疑態度，畢竟策略利潤空間有限，多者入而利薄，直到較近某次面談，發現公司模式轉變，目標客戶區分開，橫向是我所認可的分析工具平臺，縱向是我想要加入的量化私募，恰巧有高頻組，聊了幾次高頻做法和問題，入夥了。團隊很贊，運維 Oracle/Sogou/電信，前端 阿里大數據，策略 百度深度學習，以及對面做互聯網平臺的背靜不詳。高頻策略是在第一週就可以溝通改情景了，然而系統適應了一個月還沒有完全吃透，以至於現在邊讀書，邊補刷幾種編程和數據庫語言。 灣區這段時間，輪軸轉找幾個計劃內的方向課程，AI、Robotic、MSE、CME、參加Seminar、跟Minerva的小姐妹重聚，現在已是精簡清晰，很有收穫。一次芝加哥行，更是最爲難忘的經歷，像是做了最想做的跟那裏有關的一切事。做爲一個勵志做衍生品的孩子，對貿易中心和衍生品聖殿有着天然崇拜。回程選擇 California Zephyr 是因爲 Amtrak 系統以芝加哥爲中心延伸向全美國八條鐵路中 Zephyr 據說是最美的一條，50小時的車程，在餐車遇見讀物理Ph.D做機器人的，熱心給我講他們的 Graph Programming Language 是怎樣不同於一般編程語言；一大隊出來旅行的夫婦們逗比談天；一對美如畫的男同性戀；一個紋身師；一個會四五種語言的加州姑娘，從紐約一路做到三藩，我當時直接給她推薦了西伯利亞大鐵路！Zephyr 從Colorado開始跑了一天的山景，Salt Lake City 開始飽覽四季，從暴雪到豔陽天。 馬上要回京歸隊了，幾個小時前聽說公司董事層的新決議，一氣呵成寫了這麼一篇。說不上是階段性的，但是有些變化大概是內心種子的萌芽，有些破殼而是不必擔憂外界的壓力的，一切看起來天馬行空，而又有章可循。很喜歡自己的直覺，這麼多年後也終於開始享受自己背景的“古怪”，每一步令人難以理解的選擇，在不遠的將來都是回味無窮。 願我們都能找到並享受自我的獨特。👣 RoboticBarbie@ Palo AltoJan
